# Backend Code Challenge

Welcome!

For this code challenge we would like you to write a simple NodeJS REST API project or just fork one of the existing projects on Github (https://github.com/ealeksandrov/NodeAPI or https://github.com/scotch-io/node-api), and then extend it with some functionalities below.


## Adding MongoDB

Write an API endpoint for saving a JSON object in MongoDB. Mongo DB should be running in a Docker Container.

- Input:
  - JSON Object
- Output:
  - 200 OK or error code

Write also an API endpoint for getting a list of all previously saved JSON objects filtered by some field’s value, in pages, N objects per page:

- Input:
  - field’s value
  - page number
- Output:
  - list of JSON objects (no more than N)


## Adding Tests

Write end-to-end test(s) for these 2 endpoints.

Tests should be rerunnable and independent of their execution order. Make sure you test the most tricky cases.


## Adding Caching

Start Redis in Docker (same way as Mongo) and implement Redis caching for the second endpoint (get list).


## Running everything

Ensure that we're able to setup and run everything a task runner or a similar tool.


## How to deliver the results

The result should be a repository on Github with instructions how to run tests.
